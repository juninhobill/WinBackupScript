# WinBackupScript
Backup script for Windows.

Just put the file on some folder and set the paths for the folders and files you want to backup in the BackupConfig.txt file, run the BackupScript.bat script and it will generate a 7zip file with all the folders and files selected.

Do not forget to comment or set the right paths for each of the places you want to copy the backup 7zip file created (Google Drive, OneDrive or some folder on some Server).
